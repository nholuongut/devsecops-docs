# Security and Compliance

Compliance and security is nholuongut's bread-and-butter. The core approach is out-of-box compliance where the users don't have to explicitly learn and apply compliance controls. Following are some of the white papers on how nholuongut implements security and compliance

* [PCI ](https://nholuongut.com/white-papers/pci-and-hipaa-compliance-with-nholuongut/)
* [HIPAA](https://nholuongut.com/white-papers/pci-and-hipaa-compliance-with-nholuongut/)
* [SOC 2](https://nholuongut.com/white-papers/soc-2-compliance-with-nholuongut/)
* [HiTrust](https://nholuongut.com/white-papers/pci-and-hipaa-compliance-with-nholuongut/)

We support several other standards including NIST, ISO, GDPR and so on.&#x20;
