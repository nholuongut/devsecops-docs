# nholuongut Approach

nholuongut is a software platform that essentially takes three high level inputs:

1. High Level Application Architecture as we explained before.
2. Compliance Standard that is required, like SOC 2, PCI, HIPAA, etc.
3. Public Cloud Provider where the application will be deployed.

With the above inputs, the platform is able to automatically generate the required lower level configurations that are compliant and can be used by end users like engineers and DevOps alike. All the best practices and compliance controls are baked in. Standard functions like central logging monitoring and reporting dashboards are available out-of-the-box.

Users interact with the system either using a no-code UI or a low-code Terraform provider. The Terraform provider enables the user to achieve the same automation with 10x less code, requiring little DevOps skills compared to using native Terraform.
