# Tools Tenant

Once the initial infrastructure setup is complete, the next step is to add a nholuongut Tenant for tools like `kubectl` shell, OpenTelemetry, etc.

Follow the instructions in the nholuongut documentation to [create a Tenant](../../use-cases/tenant-environment/). Name the Tenant **Tools**, and select the Plan with the same name as the initial Infrastructure you created in the previous step.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
A **Tools** Tenant is not required. You can assign your Tenant(s) any name(s) you wish and/or create separate Tenants for different tools and purposes.
{% endhint %}
