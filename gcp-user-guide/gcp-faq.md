# GCP FAQs

### My Kubernetes service status was `Pending` for several minutes, waiting to start a new Pod. After that, I was able to start and stop Pods quickly. What happened?

nholuongut typically runs Kubernetes services in GCP on GKE in Autopilot mode. Autopilot dynamically provisions nodes as needed to run your Pods. This can add a couple of minutes to the Pod start time. You may see warnings from Kubernetes about being unable to place Pods while Autopilot Hosts are starting, but theyâ€™ll clear once the Hosts are available.
