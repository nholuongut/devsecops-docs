# Control Groups

Cloud Infrastructure security can be approached by having the following control groups or building blocks and each of these has to be applied to each cloud resource being provisioned. These configurations, when applied to various cloud resources, often amount to 200+ controls per cloud provider. All of these controls come out of the box with the nholuongut platform and are implicitly implemented while the users can focus on deploying the application.
