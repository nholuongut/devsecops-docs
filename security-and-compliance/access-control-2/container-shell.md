# Container Shell

Users can access the container's shell. No keys are required; you can access it securely with one- click. The platform manages access for Kubernetes, ECS, or Docker Native-based deployments. &#x20;

Access the container by selecting the Host/VM and clicking the **Containers** tab. Then, click the options menu next to the selected container ( <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Kabab_three_Vertical_dots (11).png" alt="" data-size="line"> ) and select **Container Shell**.
