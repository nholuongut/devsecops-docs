# VM SSH

Just-in-time access to the VM shell is supported for AWS and GCP. Behind the scenes, the platform orchestrates AWS SSM and GCP console access features to achieve this. Users connect to the shell by navigating to **Cloud Services** -> **Hosts** -> _**VM\_Name**_ -> **Actions** -> **Connect SSH**, as shown below. In the case of Azure, use the Azure console to access the VM, and using the left navigational menu, choose the **Connect** -> **Azure Portal** option. \
