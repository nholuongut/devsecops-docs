# File Integrity Monitoring

The nholuongut platform leverages OSSEC to implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM). Agents on Hosts monitor the key files for any changes, verifying the checksum and attributes of the monitored files. A System Check runs every twelve (12) hours. To verify FIM, navigate to **SIEM** and click I**ntegrity Monitoring**. For more information, refer to the [Wazuh Vulnerability Detection Guide](https://documentation.wazuh.com/3.9/user-manual/capabilities/file-integrity/index.html).
