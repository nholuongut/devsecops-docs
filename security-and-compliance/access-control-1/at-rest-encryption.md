# At Rest Encryption

nholuongut generates a cloud provider-specific encryption key for each tenant. While creating resources it encrypts them either with a generic cloud provider key or the user can choose a separate key per Tenant.&#x20;

Users can also create their unique encryption keys and add them using the **Administrator** -> **Plan** -> **KMS** menu and these can be used to encrypt resources At Rest.&#x20;
