# Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines is a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) service built into Azure DevOps, Microsoft's successor to Team Foundation Server. Pipelines allow developers to automatically build, test, and deploy their code every time they push changes to an Azure Repos repository.

Key features of Azure Pipelines include:

* **Easy setup**: Pipelines are built into Azure DevOps, so it's easy to get started with no additional setup.
* **Flexible configuration**: Pipelines can be configured using YAML files, allowing for high customization.
* **Docker support**: Pipelines uses Docker containers to provide a consistent and isolated environment for running builds and tests.
* **Parallel builds**: Pipelines can run multiple builds in parallel, which can help speed up the overall build process.
* **Deployment options**: Pipelines can deploy your code to various platforms, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.
