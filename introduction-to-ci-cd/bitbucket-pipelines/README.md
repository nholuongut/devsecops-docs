# Bitbucket Pipelines

Bitbucket Pipelines is a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) service built into Bitbucket, Atlassian's Git-based version control system. Pipelines allow developers to automatically build, test, and deploy their code every time they push changes to a Bitbucket repository.

Here are some key features of Bitbucket Pipelines:

* **Easy setup**: Pipelines are built into Bitbucket, so it's easy to get started with no additional setup.
* **Flexible configuration**: Pipelines can be configured using YAML files, allowing for high customization.
* **Docker support**: Pipelines uses Docker containers to provide a consistent and isolated environment for running builds and tests.
* **Parallel builds**: Pipelines can run multiple builds in parallel, which can help speed up the overall build process.
* **Deployment options**: Pipelines can deploy your code to various platforms, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.
