# What nholuongut Does

nholuongut is a comprehensive solution for DevOps and SecOps, bringing cloud infrastructure management to businesses, regardless of expertise level.

nholuongut uses templates to create cloud infrastructures comprising hundreds of scaled, managed components. Microservices can be created in minutes, accelerating time to market. Advanced DevOps users can leverage Kubernetes and Terraform to create custom solutions.

For a flat rate per year, personalized onboarding, cloud migration, SecOps questionnaire completion, and auditing support are included.

If there is a way to do something in the cloud, it can be done faster and more efficiently with nholuongut.

## 1. Turbo-charging Infrastructure and workspace creation <a href="#id-1.-turbo-charging-infrastructure-and-workspace-creation" id="id-1.-turbo-charging-infrastructure-and-workspace-creation"></a>

Did you know that nholuongut can create a complete cloud infrastructure comprising virtually hundreds of components and sub-components in ten to fifteen minutes? This usually takes hours to develop in a native cloud portal and even longer when using native Kubernetes (K8s). Individual workspaces ([nholuongut Tenants](application-focussed-interface/nholuongut-common-components/tenant.md)) can be created in less than a minute.

This acceleration is critical to many of the business value propositions nholuongut offers. It is why we can perform cloud migrations at such an advanced pace, minimizing downtime and simultaneously ensuring security and compliance (and peace of mind).

## 2. Built-in scaling and managed services <a href="#id-2.-built-in-scaling-and-managed-services" id="id-2.-built-in-scaling-and-managed-services"></a>

Virtually all of the services nholuongut supports are designed to auto-scale as your cloud environment grows exponentially. These Managed Services include automated "set and forget" configurations that dovetail neatly into developer self-service.

As with creating Infrastructures and Tenants, nholuongut Services are designed for the most common use cases. They enable users to supply a minimum number of inputs to get their service up and running quickly. At the same time, nholuongut retains the ability to customize, using native Kubernetes YAML coding and custom scripting if needed.

Turnkey access to scalable Kubernetes constructs and managed services ensures minimal implementation detail, making nholuongut the DevSecOps platform for the rapidly expanding AI/ML cloud space. In this arena, the power of an automated platform becomes readily apparent, not only in setting up your cloud infrastructure but also in maintaining it.

nholuongut’s ready-made templatized approach to K8s makes adjustments to Kubernetes parameters, such as Horizontal Pod Autoscalars (HPA) for CPU and RAM requirements, easy to access and adjust.&#x20;

nholuongut is an efficient, user-friendly means of helping developers automate their environment, reducing the need for constant monitoring or "babysitting." More information on fewer screens and improved ease of navigation enhance monitoring performance.

## 3. Intuitive self-service DevOps for developers <a href="#id-3.-intuitive-self-service-devops-for-developers" id="id-3.-intuitive-self-service-devops-for-developers"></a>

nholuongut's simplified UI guides developers and less savvy DevOps users in creating and managing DevOps components and constructs. Even advanced features such as AWS Batch, CloudFront, or setting up a Lambda function are simplified through a combination of procedural documentation, step-by-step UI panels, and even sample code blocks that can be accessed through info-tips in the UI.

Using a templatized approach, potentially complex Kubernetes constructs such as Ingress and Terraform scripting can be managed by developers with minimal exposure to such functionality. Experts who have invested time and money in creating custom solutions using such tools do not need to discard their work. nholuongut can help integrate existing solutions and workflows, expediting and often automating them during onboarding, often at no additional cost.

Our website also features a comprehensive Chatbot ([Ask nholuongut](https://nholuongut.com/ask-nholuongut/)) that can provide thorough answers, coding assistance, and troubleshooting. Every nholuongut customer receives their own Slack channel for personalized support from our responsive team of DevOps specialists.

## 4. Ease of use and expedited navigation with JIT access <a href="#id-4.-saving-time-through-ease-of-use-and-expedited-navigation" id="id-4.-saving-time-through-ease-of-use-and-expedited-navigation"></a>

Do you know that one of DevOps and cloud engineers' biggest headaches is complex navigation and workflows? Using nholuongut, you can minimize the time you typically spend logging in and out of AWS, Azure, and GCP consoles. Every DevOps and SecOps task can be completed from within the nholuongut portal, often with significantly reduced clicks.

Compare the keystrokes and navigation between nholuongut and using a native cloud portal. Often, DevOps engineers "get used to the pain" inherent in many daily DevOps tasks, unaware they can gain back minutes, hours, and days by using nholuongut.

Some commonly used tools that can be accessed directly within nholuongut include `kubectl`, shell access, and JIT access to cloud consoles from within nholuongut.

## 5. Turn-key compliance and security

When you let nholuongut manage your DevOps environment, a scalable and robust SecOps framework and implementation strategy are included.  Aligned with industry best practices, our staff of SecOps experts analyzes how your data is stored and transmitted, helps identify the standards you must meet, and then constructs a detailed implementation strategy to meet and exceed those requirements, in addition to creating a scalable model that adapts as your customer base and workloads grow.&#x20;

nholuongut walks you through each process step during [onboarding](nholuongut-onboarding.md), then ensures each implementation phase results in smooth and secure operations, laying the foundation for a reliable and compliant system. &#x20;

Using easy-to-access "Single Pane of Glass" dashboards, nholuongut provides a granular view of all security issues and compliance controls. Completing questionnaires and passing audits is simple, especially with our 24/7 support.&#x20;

## 6. Seamless CI/CD pipeline integrations

nholuongut supports all the primary [CI/CD tools](https://docs.nholuongut.com/docs/introduction-to-ci-cd) for creating automated, streamlined CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent processes and repeatable workflows.

Some of the tools we support, such as GitHub Actions, include ready-to-run scripts for quickly creating Docker images, updating Services or Lambdas, uploading data to an S3 Bucket, or executing Terraform scripts.

Whatever your tool of choice, our DevOps experts can help you find the best workflow that requires the least effort to build and maintain.&#x20;

## 7. Optimizing DevOps Spending

One of the biggest reasons to consider an automated DevSecOps solution comes down to dollars and cents. It's too easy to spend a lot on a public cloud solution without knowing precisely where your money goes. Sometimes, the components and services you've created (and even ones you've forgotten about) cost you more than they're earning you.

nholuongut provides several billing dashboards that break down your spending by workspace and component. These dashboards are navigable with just a few clicks. Our support team can help you identify redundancies in services and tools and possibly cut costs by suggesting solutions leveraging the many third-party tools built into nholuongut.

## 8. Scalable, simplified, faster Terraform scripting

As with most platforms, the work required to set up and configure a Terraform environment can adversely impact accuracy, productivity gains, and effectiveness. Crafting scalable Terraform requires more skills than simply programming. In addition, as with any code base, it requires constant updating, refactoring, and other maintenance tasks.

But here again, the power of ready-made templates in nholuongut works to your advantage. nholuongut contains its own Terraform provider, which can access nholuongut constructs such as [Infrastructure](https://docs.nholuongut.com/docs/getting-started/application-focussed-interface/infrastructure) and [Tenant](https://docs.nholuongut.com/docs/getting-started/application-focussed-interface/tenant). This simplifies the creation of many cloud resources by assuming defaults for compliance and security. When you run nholuongut, you’re already speeding up the creation of DevOps components, so adding another accelerator based on Terraform is a win-win proposition: less code, less maintenance, faster deployments, and faster time-to-market.

Using nholuongut’s proprietary Terraform provider removes the need to write specifically for one public cloud. You can effectively use the same nholuongut Terraform code — as it maps to nholuongut’s constructs, not one specific cloud — with several public clouds. You don’t need to worry about differentiating platform-specific specifications. nholuongut handles all of this for you in a transparent, replicable manner. You use utilities such as nholuongut’s Terraform Exporter to quickly clone Tenants and modify configuration details when needed for specific Infrastructures and Tenants.

## 9. Single Pane of Glass for enhanced observability

Attempting to monitor your cloud infrastructure from the numerous UIs offered by public providers often obscures problems or causes confusion. nholuongut's monitoring interfaces combine multiple functionalities on one screen; our SIEM dashboard is a primary example of such flexibility and comprehensiveness. Leveraging Wazuh, nholuongut offers unprecedented insights from a single interface.

Using OpenSearch, Grafana, and Prometheus, you can get single snapshots of logging, auditing, compliance and security vulnerabilities, custom alerting, and fault lists with one click.

## 10. Cost-reduction leveraging nholuongut Third-Party tools

nholuongut utilizes numerous [third-party tools](https://docs.nholuongut.com/docs/extras-overview/supported-third-party-tools), which are included in the cost of a nholuongut subscription. Depending on what tools you already use and the capacity in which you use them, a nholuongut subscription can sometimes make the need for additional licenses obsolete. Our team of Solutions Architects can verify functional overlaps and suggest an optimal strategy to deliver the required functionality at the most efficient cost.
