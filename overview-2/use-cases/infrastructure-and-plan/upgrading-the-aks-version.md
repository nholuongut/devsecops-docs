# Upgrading the AKS version

Microsoft frequently updates the version of AKS based on new features that are available in the Kubernetes platform.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
nholuongut pushes AKS upgrades to the nholuongut Portal code, but we request that you contact the nholuongut Support staff on your Slack channel or by email when upgrading, for the moment.
{% endhint %}

In future releases, this upgrade will be available for customers to install.
