# Public IP Address Prefix

A [Public IP Address Prefix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-address-prefix) reserves a range of consecutive public IP addresses that you can individually assign to public resources. This is useful for scaling because it provides a globally unique address space, supports expansion across locations, facilitates load balancing, enables secure access control, and is fundamental for connecting to multiple ISPs and participating in internet routing protocols.
