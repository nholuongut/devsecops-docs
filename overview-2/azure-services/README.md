# Azure Services

nholuongut provides a number of configurable components when running Microsoft Azure's Managed Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Applications involve many Azure Services like Storage Account, RDS for RDBS (MySQL), Redis, VM Scale Sets, Ingress, ALB/NLB load balancers, and so on. While each of their configurations needs a few application-centric inputs, there are scores of lower-level nuances around access control, security, and compliance.

Using nholuongut you can create virtually any service within the Tenant using basic application-centric inputs. At the same time, the platform will make sure the lower-level nuances are programmed to best practices for security and compliance.&#x20;
