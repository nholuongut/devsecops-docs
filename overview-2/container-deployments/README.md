# Container deployments

The majority of workloads deployed on nholuongut are in Docker containers.

nholuongut supports virtually all orchestration techniques across multiple cloud providers, using a simplified and cloud-neutral interface. On Microsoft Azure, orchestration includes support for Managed Kubernetes Service (AKS), and WebApps in Azure, and native Docker Containers.

In addition, the nholuongut platform has a built-in container management platform that provides an alternative to Kubernetes, which can be complex to implement.

nholuongut supports many types of applications in Azure, including but not limited to:

* Dockerized apps constitute about 90% of our user workloads. The platform orchestrates containerized application deployments using AKS or built-in container orchestrations as defined in the [Container orchestration features](../../overview-1/container-deployments/container-orchestrators.md) section.
