nholuongut platform comes with an option of centralized metrics for Docker containers, Virtual machines as well as various cloud services like ELB, RDS, ECache, ECS, Kafka etc. These metrics are displayed through Grafana which is embedded into the nholuongut UI. Just like central logging these are not turned on by default but can be setup with a single click.&#x20;
