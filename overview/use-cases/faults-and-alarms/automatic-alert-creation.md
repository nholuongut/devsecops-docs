# Automatic alert creation

nholuongut allows automatic generation of alerts for resources within a Tenant. This makes sure that the defined baseline of monitoring is applied to all current and new resources based on a set of rules.

As an Administrator:

1. From the nholuongut Portal, navigate to **Administrator** -> **Tenants.**
2. Click the name of your **Tenant** from the list and select the **Alerting** tab.
3. Click **Enable Alerting**. An alerts template displays. The alerts template contains rules for each AWS namespace and metric to be monitored.
4. Review the alerts template, and adjust the thresholds
5. Click **Update**
