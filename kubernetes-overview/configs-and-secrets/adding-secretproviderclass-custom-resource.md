# Creating the SecretProviderClass Custom Resource to mount secrets

nholuongut Portal provides the ability to create Custom Resource (CR) `SecretProviderClass`.

This capability allows Kubernetes (K8s) to mount secrets stored in external secrets stores into the Pods as volumes. After the volumes are attached, the data is mounted into the containerâ€™s file system.

## Prerequisites

An Administrator must set the Infrastructure setting  `Enable Secrets CSI Driver` as `True`. This setting is available by navigating to **Administrator** -> **Infrastructure**, selecting your Infrastructure, and clicking **Settings**).

## Creating the K8s SecretProviderClass&#x20;

1. In the nholuongut Portal, navigate to **Kubernetes** -> **Secret Provider.**
2. Click **Add**. The **Add Kubernetes Sercet Provider Class** page displays.
3. Map the `AWS Secrets` and `SSM Parameters` configured in nholuongut Portal (**Cloud Services** -> **App Integration**) to the **Parameters** section of the configuration.
4. Optionally, use the **Secret Objects** field to define the desired state of the synced Kubernetes secret objects.

The following is an example `SecretProviderClass` configuration where AWS secrets and Kubernetes Secret Objects are configured:

## **Creating a Kubernetes Service and mounting** volumes based on the configured secrets

To ensure your application is using the Secrets Store CSI driver, you need to configure your deployment to reference the `SecretProviderClass` resource created in the previous step.

The following is an example of configuring a Pod to mount a volume based on the `SecretProviderClass` created in prior steps to retrieve secrets from Secrets Manager.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's important to note that SPC timeouts can occur due to issues related to Secret Auto Rotation, which is enabled by default. This feature checks every two (2) minutes if the secrets need to be updated from the values in AWS Secrets Manager. During a service deployment, if a secret is deleted due to a redeployment while a rotation check is attempted, it can lead to timeouts. This deletion happens because the secret is generated from the volume mount in the service Pod, and when the Pod is destroyed, the secret is also destroyed.
{% endhint %}

1. In the nholuongut Portal, create a Kubernetes Service by navigating to **Kubernetes** -> **Services** and clicking **Add**.&#x20;
2.  Complete the required fields and click **Next** to display the **Advanced Options** page.

3.  On the **Advanced Options** page, in the **Cloud Credentials** list box, select **From Kubernetes**.

    </div>


4. Add code to the **Other Pod Config** field, as in the example below.
5. Add code for `VolumeMounts` in the **Other Container Config** field, as in the example below.
6. Click **Create** to create the Kubernetes service.

{% code title="Other Pod Config field" %}
```yaml
Volumes:
  - Name: secretvolume-name
    Csi:
      driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
      readOnly: true
      VolumeAttributes:
        secretProviderClass: my-secret-provider-class

```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Other Container Config field" %}
```yaml
VolumesMounts:
  - Name: secretvolume-name
    MountPath: /mnt/secrets
    readOnly: true

```
{% endcode %}

## Configure and use Kubernetes Secret Objects

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you can sync Kubernetes Secret Objects, you must [Create a Kubernetes Service and mount volumes based on the configured secrets](adding-secretproviderclass-custom-resource.md#create-a-kubernetes-service-and-mount-volumes-based-on-the-configured-secrets).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Optionally, you can define `secretObjects` in the `SecretProviderClass` to define the desired state of your synced Kubernetes secret objects.&#x20;

The following is an example of how to create a `SecretProviderClass` CR that syncs a secret from AWS Secrets Manager to a Kubernetes secret:

### Configuring Secret Objects in deployments

In the **Other Container Config** field, specify mount details with the `secretobject-name`. Refer to the following example:

{% code title="Other Container Config field" %}
```yaml
VolumesMounts:
  - Name: secretvolume-name
    MountPath: /mnt/secrets
    readOnly: true
EnvFrom:
  - SecretRef:
      Name: secretobject-name
```
{% endcode %}

### Configuring Secret Objects using Environment Variables

Set environment variables in your deployment to refer to your Kubernetes secrets.

Refer to the following example using the **Environment Variables** field in the **Basic Options** page when [creating a Service](adding-secretproviderclass-custom-resource.md#create-a-kubernetes-service-and-mount-volumes-based-on-the-configured-secrets).

{% code title="Environment Variables field" %}
```yaml
- name: SECRET_USERNAME
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: secretobject-name
      key: secret-text
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="success" %}
While powerful, integrating secrets into Kubernetes deployments requires careful management to avoid issues such as SPC timeouts. Understanding the underlying mechanisms, such as Secret Auto Rotation and the lifecycle of secrets in Pod deployments, is crucial for smooth operations.
