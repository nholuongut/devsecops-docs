**NARRATOR:**

Building and operating infrastructure in the public cloud is challenging.

It revolves around the five pillars of operational excellence, security, reliability, performance, and cost optimization.&#x20;

This is a broad taxonomy of thought operations.&#x20;

It starts from building a network infrastructure that includes VPCs and hybrid connectivity.&#x20;

Next comes application infrastructure. This involves virtual machines, data stores, along with the right security policies and backup configuration.&#x20;

On top of the app infra is app provisioning where we see Kubernetes, serverless, and spark clusters.&#x20;

There's logging and monitoring. CI/CD makes this a repeatable process.&#x20;

Compliance controls are needed across the board.&#x20;

Today, certified cloud experts automate these functions by manually writing code that spans thousands of lines.&#x20;

We see cargo culting, with every engineer, bringing their own style, favorite programming language, and tools.&#x20;

With expanding infrastructure, the size of the codebase and team grows.&#x20;

The bigger the system, the harder to make changes, decreasing productivity.&#x20;

One has to understand what code to change.&#x20;

Once updated, peers need to do code review, then tests are to be performed, followed by a roll out.&#x20;

A simple user request to open a port for an application requires subject matter experts and still takes days.&#x20;

Lack of cloud subject matter experts is the single biggest blocker to cloud adoption.&#x20;

Hiring a DevOps workforce is hard and expensive. Today, on average, to build and operate a 50-VM cloud infrastructure, companies require two DevSecOps engineers.&#x20;

But did you know that inside Amazon and Microsoft, they manage millions of virtual machines with only 1000-odd people?&#x20;

To understand how, imagine for a moment being assisted by a DevOps bot, which had the ability to auto-generate this infrastructure configuration based on a rules engine that combines user requirements, subject matter expertise, and principles of a well-architected framework.&#x20;

Cloud operations might very well involve thousands of configurations that overwhelm humans, but in the age of AI, bots can auto-generate these.&#x20;

At nholuongut, we have built such a robot.&#x20;

The bot installs in a virtual machine in your cloud account.&#x20;

Users can easily interface it with it through a browser or API. There, they configure their application needs in simple declarative terms and the bot auto-generates the underlying infrastructure policies.&#x20;

Whether doing a first-time deployment or ongoing operations, it manages a complete application and infrastructure life cycle.&#x20;

Today, the bots are operational in over 25 enterprises, managing over 3000 virtual machines, and 250 applications.&#x20;

Users do 5000 self-service deployments a week.&#x20;
