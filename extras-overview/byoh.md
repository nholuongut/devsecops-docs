# BYOH

## Introduction <a href="#id-0-toc-title" id="id-0-toc-title"></a>

If you have a host already running somewhere in the cloud or on-premise, you can bring that to nholuongut using BYOH functionality and let nholuongut manage the host, let it be running the containers or installing the compliance agents.

## Add new BYO host <a href="#id-1-toc-title" id="id-1-toc-title"></a>

To configure BYOH go to **Cloud Services** -> **Hosts**, and select the **BYOH** tab. Click on **Add** and provide the name, IP Address and in the Fleet type select Native App (if you donâ€™t, nholuongut will not manage the containers but manage the compliance agents on the host), provide the username, password/Private key file. Make sure SSH access to the host is opened to access from nholuongut.

## Confirm server agent status <a href="#id-2-toc-title" id="id-2-toc-title"></a>

Within about 5 minutes of adding the host, you can go to **Security** -> **Agents** and see that the agent on host is in Active state.
